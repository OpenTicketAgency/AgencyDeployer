                        Open Ticket Agency is a smart contract that allows you to create ticketing service for your shows, 
                        concerts or any other kind of event. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Event organizers create an agency contract for their series of shows, 
                        and then create show contracts for each show in the series. 
                        Each show contract has a set of seat types, and each seat type has a set of seats. 
                        Prices for each seat type are set by the event organizer, 
                        and then the event organizer sells tickets to the show through the show contract.
