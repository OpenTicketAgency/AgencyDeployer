# Open ticket agency deployer

This is a simple tool to deploy a Open Ticket Agency's agency contract.

## Usage

Before you start, you need to have a working TicketAgencyFactory contract deployed on local anvil or some other Ethereum network. And you need to have a valid private key for the account that will deploy the agency. It's nice to use a pair of private key and address that the anvil prompt gives you when you start it.

```bash
$ anvil
                            _   _
                            (_) | |
      __ _   _ __   __   __  _  | |
     / _` | | '_ \  \ \ / / | | | |
    | (_| | | | | |  \ V /  | | | |
     \__,_| |_| |_|   \_/   |_| |_|
